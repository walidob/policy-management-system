# Policy Management System API

## Architecture Overview

The Policy Management System API is built on a highly scalable, multi-tenant architecture using .NET 9 and follows Clean Architecture principles. The backend is structured into five distinct layers:

- **API Layer** (`PolicyManagementApp.Api`): Handles HTTP requests, routing, controllers, and output caching
- **Application Layer** (`PolicyManagement.Application`): Contains business logic, interfaces, DTOs, and validation
- **Domain Layer** (`PolicyManagement.Domain`): Defines entities, domain logic, and business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`PolicyManagement.Infrastructure`): Implements cross-cutting concerns, services, and external integrations
- **Persistence Layer** (`PolicyManagement.Persistence`): Manages data access, migrations, and multi-tenant storage

This Clean Architecture approach ensures separation of concerns, making the system maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

## Key Features

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system implements a robust multi-tenant approach using Finbuckle.MultiTenant that goes beyond the basic requirements:

- **Dynamic Connection Strings**: Each tenant has its own dedicated database connection string
- **Tenant Resolution**: Uses claim-based tenant identification strategy ("apptenid")
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data isolation between tenants with separate databases
- **CRUD Operations for Tenants**: Extended functionality beyond requirements to fully manage tenants
- **Dynamic DB Migration**: Automatic migration handling for all tenant databases
- **Tenant-Specific Configurations**: Each tenant can have unique settings
- **Tenant Context Awareness**: All operations aware of current tenant context
- **Tenant Provisioning**: On-demand creation of tenant databases
- **Multi-Tenant Repository Pattern**: Data access abstracted with tenant awareness

The multi-tenant design allows for complete isolation between insurance companies while maintaining a single codebase and deployment.

### RESTful API Design

- **Resource-based Endpoints**: Following REST principles for all entities
- **Proper HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods used appropriately
- **Status Codes**: Consistent HTTP status code usage (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- **Output Caching**: Efficient caching with policy-based expiration strategies
- **Consistent Response Format**: Standardized response structure
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: API documentation using Scalar.AspNetCore
- **Resource Filtering**: Query parameter support for filtering
- **Pagination**: Consistent pagination approach across resources

### Performance Optimization

- **Output Cache**: Configured with tag-based policy caching for different resources:
  - Default expiration of 5 minutes for general endpoints
  - 10-minute cache for Policies and Clients endpoints
  - 15-minute cache for Tenants endpoints
  - Response header caching indicators
- **In-Memory Cache**: Implemented for frequently accessed data, which can be easily replaced with Redis
- **Response Compression**: HTTPS compression enabled for all responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with sophisticated IP-based rate limiting (100 requests per minute globally)
- **Efficient Database Queries**: Optimized EF Core queries with proper indexing
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Non-blocking I/O operations throughout the codebase
- **Minimal Payload Size**: DTOs designed to minimize response size

### Security Implementation

- **Identity Framework**: Advanced user management with custom roles
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements enforced (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: HSTS implementation with proper configuration
- **Strict Cookie Policy**: Secure and HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks with IP-based throttling
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **Prevention of Common Vulnerabilities**: XSS, CSRF, injection attacks
- **JWT Token Validation**: Proper audience, issuer, lifetime, and signature validation
- **Secure Header Policies**: Security-related HTTP headers
